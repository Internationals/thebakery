        <h4>The International Bakery</h4>
        <p>
            International Bakery has been cherished for its classic Indian, Brazillian, Italian baked goods, vintage decor and warm, inviting atmosphere.
            <br />
            We have thoughtfully expanded the bakery from its first West Village shop to locations worldwide.<br />
            Today, we can be found in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Beirut, Kuwait City, India and Doha.<br />
            In addition to our current location in Louisville.<br />
            International Bakery is franchising internationally and will soon open in Tokyo, Japan; Moscow, Russia; and Mexico City, Mexico.<br />
            Patrons are also invited to shop, where we offer a selection of freshly baked cupcakes, cookies, brownies and bars, as well as corporate gift packages and seasonal assortments.<br />
            <hr />
            Cookies are made of butter and love.<br />
            Ice cream is happiness condensed.<br />
            Anything is good if it&#39s made of chocolate.<br />

            Great desserts. Great people. That&#39s what The Bakery is all about.<br />
            We look for individuals who share our passion for producing freshly baked desserts with outstanding customer service.
            <br />
            Our staff and their commitment to creating hand crafted desserts and providing friendly, attentive and informed customer service is what sets us apart.<br />
            <br />
            At Hon&#39s Bakery, our philanthropic efforts are guided by the notion that charity begins at home and then extends to the global community.<br />
            From daily donations to local food pantries to international relief efforts, we&#39re committed to supporting our community.
            <br />
            In the past, we&#39ve partnered with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Autism Speaks, NRDC and Michael J. Fox Foundation, among others.<br />
            In addition, we&#39ve worked with schools and organizations in our local
